# Roadmap

## Why does this project exist?

The [original official toolkit of Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software) which was written in Java is a great tool.

However, it is has many issues:

- The UI is not responsive.
- The UI looks outdated.
- The UI is not very accessible.
- Many parts of the UI tend to cut off text.
- The error messages are very short.
- It requires Java to be installed.
- and more.

This project aims to solve all of these issues, and be a better, more modern, and more accessible version of the original official toolkit.

## Vision

The new toolkit would be a web app, which would be accessible from any device with a web browser, instantly, without any installation.

It would include all the features of the original toolkit, and more.

It would be designed following modern design principles, and would be responsive and accessible.
